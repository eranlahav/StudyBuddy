## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Key decisions affecting current work:
- Fresh profile start (no history bootstrap) — Cleaner data, avoid noise from old sessions
- Parents only see analytics — Protect child motivation, avoid "weakness" framing
- Focus quizzes on weaknesses — Most efficient learning path
- Full parent control over AI — Parent authority over child's education
- Full learning model (not simple tracking) — Maximize value of AI, predict mastery

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 Readiness:**
- BKT parameters (pKnown, pLearn, pGuess, pSlip) need calibration with real usage data after implementation
- Gemini API cost monitoring required (batch API calls, implement caching)

**Phase 3 Readiness:**
- Gemini prompt engineering for Hebrew educational context may need iteration
- User testing with 5-10 Israeli parent families recommended before broader rollout

**Phase 5 Readiness:**
- Forgetting curve decay rates (0.95-0.98/week) may need tuning after 30-60 days of data collection
- Prerequisite relationship accuracy unknown for Israeli curriculum variations
