# Requirements - Adaptive Learning Profiles

## v1 Requirements

### PROF - Learning Profile Foundation
- **PROF-01**: Comprehensive learning profile per child showing gaps, progress, next steps
- **PROF-02**: Profile analytics showing knowledge gap detection across subjects and topics
- **PROF-03**: Progress tracking with trend visualization showing improvement over time

### REC - AI-Powered Recommendations
- **REC-01**: AI recommendations providing prioritized next steps based on profile data
- **REC-02**: Mastery prediction - AI predicts topic mastery and identifies prerequisites
- **REC-03**: Personalized curriculum - AI-generated learning path per child

### PARENT - Parent Control
- **PARENT-01**: Parent override capability to override AI priorities
- **PARENT-02**: Parent context - parents can add notes/observations that inform the profile
- **PARENT-03**: Parent goals - parents can set learning targets (e.g., "master fractions by June")
- **PARENT-04**: Profile editing - parents can directly edit profile entries and priorities

### ADAPT - Quiz Adaptation
- **ADAPT-01**: Quiz generator uses profile to focus on weaknesses
- **ADAPT-02**: Profile learns from quiz performance (answers, timing, patterns)

### SIGNAL - Multi-Signal Integration
- **SIGNAL-01**: Profile learns from scanned school evaluations
- **SIGNAL-02**: Engagement signals - profile detects avoidance patterns, session behavior
- **SIGNAL-03**: Parent observations - parent notes feed into profile (e.g., "she guessed on #3")

## v2 Requirements (Out of Scope)

- Profile visible to children
- Bootstrap from history (profile starts fresh)
- Teacher/school integration
- Cross-family insights
- Automated parent notifications
