- **PREREQ-02**: Explain "fix X first" logic in AI recommendations
- **PREREQ-03**: Call detectPrerequisites when displaying weak topics

## Implementation Notes

### Parent Notes UI
The backend service `processParentNoteSignal` already exists in `services/signalService.ts`. This feature set adds the UI layer to expose this functionality to parents during session review.

### Prerequisite Display
The `detectPrerequisites` function exists in `services/prerequisiteService.ts`. These requirements wire the AI-powered dependency detection to the UI so parents understand why certain topics are recommended before others.

### Mobile Responsiveness
Addresses tech debt identified in v1.0 audit. Focus on the new profile-related components added in v1.0: SkillRadarChart, ProgressTimeline, RecommendationsPanel, and AnalysisTab.
